# MyContacts
A simple application for storing phone numbers of your contacts.  
Contacts are stored in cloud storage and can be accessed from anywhere with internet access.

## Introduction
This is my test assignment for an internship at [Lad](https://lad24.ru/) company.  
The task includes writing a full-fledged application in React Native. It can be a blog, to do list, wish list, pokedex, online store, admin panel, business card website or any other application. 

#### Requirements:
- React Native (Expo CLI/React Native CLI);
- JavaScript/TypeScript;
- for state management Redux/Redux ToolKit;
- for async actions Redux-thunk.

   The app should be successfully loaded by now. Please feel free to play around and test out its features.
